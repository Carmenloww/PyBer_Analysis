# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, we are to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we are to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. A written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
